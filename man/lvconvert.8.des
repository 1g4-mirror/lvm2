lvconvert changes the LV type and includes utilities for LV data
maintenance. The LV type controls data layout and redundancy.
The LV type is also called the segment type or segtype.

To display the current LV type, run the command:

.B lvs \-o name,segtype
.I LV

The
.B linear
type is equivalent to the
.B striped
type when one stripe exists.
In that case, the types can sometimes be used interchangably.

In most cases, the
.B mirror
type is deprecated and the
.B raid1
type should be used.  They are both implementations of mirroring.

The
.B raid*
type refers to one of many raid levels, e.g.
.B raid1,
.B raid5.

In some cases, an LV is a single device mapper (dm) layer above physical
devices.  In other cases, hidden LVs (dm devices) are layered between the
visible LV and physical devices.  LVs in the middle layers are called sub LVs.
A command run on a visible LV sometimes operates on a sub LV rather than
the specified LV.  In other cases, a sub LV must be specified directly on
the command line.

Sub LVs can be displayed with the command
.B lvs -a
