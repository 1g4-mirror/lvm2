vgcfgrestore restores the metadata of a VG from a text back up file
produced by \fBvgcfgbackup\fP. This writes VG metadata onto the devices
specifed in back up file.

A back up file can be specified with \fB\-\-file\fP.  If no backup file is
specified, the most recent one is used. Use \fB\-\-list\fP for a list of
the available back up and archive files of a VG.
