vgexport can make inactive VG(s) unknown to the system.  In this state,
all the PVs in the VG can be moved to a different system, from which
\fBvgimport\fP can then be run.

.IP \[bu] 3
Most LVM tools ignore exported VGs.

.IP \[bu] 3
vgexport clears the VG system ID, and vgimport sets the VG system ID to
match the host running vgimport (if the host has a system ID).
