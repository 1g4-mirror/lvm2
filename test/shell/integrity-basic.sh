# Corrupt one file-data block per backing device, never touching parity.
#
# This is more than "find the pattern and overwrite it", for four reasons:
#
#  - The write has to land below dm-integrity, on the raid image itself.
#    Writing through the LV would let dm-integrity store a tag for the
#    damaged data, so the block would check out and nothing would repair
#    it.  That is why each image's byte range on the PV is needed: an image
#    does not start at sector 0, several LVs share a PV, and a match outside
#    the range belongs to another LV.
#
#  - The damaged block must hold file data, not parity.  With parity damaged
#    every data block is still intact, reads succeed, dm-integrity reports
#    no mismatch and the test verifies nothing.  A plain pattern search
#    cannot tell the two apart: RAID4/5 parity is the XOR of the stripe's
#    data, so while the rest of the stripe is still zero the parity member
#    holds exactly the bytes that were written.  A match can therefore be
#    the parity copy; _raid_member_is_parity() rules that out, and a skipped
#    match means retrying at the next one rather than failing.
#
#  - The stripe is taken from the middle of the match, not from its first
#    byte: a match near a chunk boundary otherwise names a stripe that the
#    corruption only partly covers, which is the decision the parity check
#    has to get right.
#
#  - Only layouts with a spelled-out parity rule are accepted (raid4,
#    raid5_ls, raid6_zr).  Any other layout dies instead of guessing and
#    silently corrupting parity.  Mirrors have no parity and need no
#    member mapping.
#
# A run that matches nothing corrupts nothing and cannot fail any later
# assertion, so the caller is responsible for giving a device list that
# really holds the file data, as described in raid_corrupt_data().
#
# Call _raid_capture_members first, while the LV is still active.  The LV
# must be deactivated before this runs and is left deactivated, so the
